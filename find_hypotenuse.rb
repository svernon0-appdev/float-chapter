# A right triangle's two shorter sides have length 2.8 and 4.5. 
# How long is its longest side?
#
# Write a program to calculate how long its longest side is and print it.
# 
# Remember: the Pythagorean Theorem says that a**2 + b**2 = c**2, 
# where `a` and `b` are the lengths of the shorter sides, and `c` is the length of the longest side
# 
# Your output should be a Float (i.e., 1.0, rather than the Integer 1)



# ~~~~~ Specs (make it do these things) ~~~~~
#
# find_hypotenuse.rb should output '5.3'
